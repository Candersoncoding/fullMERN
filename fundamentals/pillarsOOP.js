// Encapsulation is information or data that is packaged up and kept private
// Encapsulation and Abstraction are related
// Abstraction is the way that the Encapsulated data is able to be used or represented
// Inheritance is information or data that a parent class trickles down to a smaller class or instance of that class. A child is an instance of a parent.
// Inheritance and Polymorphism are related
// Polymorphism the different types of instances that inherit from a parent class. Idea of adding new information to make that child different from the other instances.(This child's ability to "change shape")
// Ex: class Vehicle is the parent class, if the child of class Vehicle is a class MotorVehicle then the motor vehicle will have all the features that the class Vehicle contains. It will have a seat, a way to steer, a way to move. Polymorphism says, there is an instance that is red, with blue wheels, and another that has wings instead of wheels and is yellow.
